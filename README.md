# Bankist Website

This is a project from [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). This course solidifies my understanding on different JavaScript concepts (e.g. DOM, Mordern OOP, Asynchronous JS and Modern tools for JS) and gives me challenging exercises and realistic project to improve my coding skills.

The website Bankist is a project to practice advanced technique in DOM manipulation.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View hover effect of the navigation bar
- View form modal by clicking buttons and close the modal by clicking button, overlay, and pressing Esc key
- View cookie bar at the bottom of header
- See the page smoothly scroll to section after clicking the navigation links
- View different content when corresponding tab is clicked
- See the scroll into view effect when user scroll into any section
- Load full resolution images before images set into view
- See the navigation stick to the top when scrolling beyond header
- View content using the slider button, dots and keyboard
