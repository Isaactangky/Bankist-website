# Bankist Website

This is a project from [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). This course solidify my understanding on different JavaScript concepts (e.g. DOM, Mordern OOP, Asynchronous JS and Modern tools for JS) and gives me useful exercises and realistic project to improve my coding skills.

The website bankist is a code-alone project to practice advanced technique in DOM manipulation.
